# CMake Template

This is a beginner friendly `cmake` for `C` projects. while it's not by all means the **"best"** approach but it's clearly crafted together and commented for you to be able to adjust it to your needs.

## Structure

- `extern` folder is where you put your external dependencies, as an example I have used `clove-unit` library for unit testing.
- `include` is where you put your exported header files.
- `src` is where your `.c` files must be placed.
- `tests` are written using `clove-unit` framework which is a lightweight and single header library. you can refer to [here](https://github.com/fdefelici/clove-unit) for more information.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** there is also `.clang-format` available for you to use.

## `CMakeLists.txt` files

By reading their source codes as they are fully commented you can understand pretty much everything you need.

## Resources

I've get the good test run control [from this place](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/chapters/testing.html). it's a good book and I highly recommend you to read it if you want to get more into cmake.

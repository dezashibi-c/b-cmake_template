# CMake Template

This is a beginner friendly `cmake` for `C` projects. while it's not by all means the **"best"** approach but it's clearly crafted together and commented for you to be able to adjust it to your needs.

## Structure

- `cmake` any utility and re-usable files for your cmakes goes here.
- `extern` folder is where you put your external dependencies, as an example I have used `clove-unit` library for unit testing.
- `include` is where you put your exported header files.
- `src` is where your `.c` files must be placed.
- `tests` are written using `clove-unit` framework which is a lightweight and single header library.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** You can refer to [here](https://github.com/fdefelici/clove-unit) for more information about `clove-unit`.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** There is also `.clang-format` available for you to use.

**ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** All the build artifacts will be placed in `out` folder, all the build artifacts for tests will be placed in `out_tests` folder.

## `CMakeLists.txt` files

By reading their source codes as they are fully commented you can understand pretty much everything you need.

But the main workflow of using this template is like this:

- in main `CMakeLists.txt`:
  1. Rename project name  in [line 11](/CMakeLists.txt#L11).
  2. Rename your desired executable file `main_exe_file` on lines [19](/CMakeLists.txt#L19) and [30](/CMakeLists.txt#L28).
  3. Every time you add a new `.c` file you add it in `EXECUTABLE TARGETS` section to one or more of your executable files.
  4. If you want to add another Target aka. executable or library feel free to repeat what's on lines [19 to 22](/CMakeLists.txt#L19-L22) also make sure to rename the variables to meet your needs.
  5. In case you want also to enable pre build testing meaning re-building and running tests every time you build certain target look at [line 28](/CMakeLists.txt#L28).

- Testing (`tests/CMakeLists.txt`):
  1. You create a new `.c` file in `tests` folder, name it like `test_<whatever>.c`, it's for readability but you don't have to.
  2. Follow `clove-unit` library guide and write your test.
  3. use `add_clove_test` with the exact name `test_<whatever>` without `.c` in `CMakeLists.txt` of `tests` directory to register your test.
  4. **ðŸ‘‰ NOTE:** Make sure to [read the guide](/tests/CMakeLists.txt#L15-L22) in the `tests` folder cmake file.

- Visual Studio Code Users:
  1. Make sure [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) and [CMake Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) extensions are installed.
  2. If you're on Windows and you haven't installed your tools yet, make sure to check out [here](https://github.com/dezashibi-c/b-hello-world?tab=readme-ov-file#portable-development-environment-for-windows-users).
  3. Just open the folder like normal and let the magic happen.

- CodeBlocks and Visual Studio 2022 Users:
  1. You need to create corresponding projects first.
  2. Open terminal in the folder (make sure you've deleted `build` folder if it already exists):
     1. Enter `cmake -B build -G"CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"` if you need CodeBlocks project.
     2. Enter `cmake -B build -G"Visual Studio 17 2022"` if you need Visual Studio project.
  3. Now open up the `build` folder and you can find project or solution for your IDE.

- KDevelop Users just open the folder and the IDE itself recognizes the `CMakeLists.txt` and will guide you through it.

- **Adding Configurations to define macros**:

    You can use `define_macro_option(<target name> <macro name in your code> <default value ON/OFF>)` after your executable or libraries. this will add `<target name>_ENABLE_<macro name you've provided>` cmake option. **ðŸ‘‰ [checkout example](/CMakeLists.txt#L24)**.

## Resources for learning `CMake`

Check out [this place](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html). it's a good book and I highly recommend you to read it if you want to get more into cmake.
